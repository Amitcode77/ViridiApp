## Introduction 📌
More than 65.6 % of people in India are living in the rural areas having the farming as the primary source to earn their living. Still the farmers did not know how to deal with the agricultural waste. Most of the farmers burn the stubbles left which results in the growing of air pollution and also having the bad impact in the soil itself which is also making the cultivity of farmers very less.

## 🏃‍♂️ Why VIRIDI 🤔?
### 1. Business Value 💼
In the context of business value, our app "VIRIDI" provides a lot of business opportunities. First of all the app is based on the use of stubble (considered as agricultural waste).  There is a craft-market in our app where anyone can sell products made from stubbles which provide opportunities for employment to many unemployed. As the raw material is very cheap, this business has a double profit. We just need to create a trend of using ecofriendly things in our country.
Our app provides the feature of buying and selling of stubble for which there is a feature called book a machine (like shipping vehicle, stubble removing machine, etc.) which provide direct job opportunities to many people. Many such business opportunities still need to be discovered - just try it..
### 2. Level of Innovation💡🔍
There is no such app across the play store and internet that is used to utilize Stubble, actually an asset that is considered as waste. There are apps present that monitor the burning of stubble and impose and huge fine on farmers, but this is not the solution of preventing the environment by stubble burning.  
In our app, we provide the best possible solution to minimize it. We created five components in our app considering all the problems of farmers and previous data. We searched for the root cause of stubble burning and arrive at this conclusion:  people don't have the right skills to use it and no proper system of stubble management and no proper market to sell their products made from stubble.
### 3. Realistic Capabilities🤖🔍
The Virirdi is developed considering its scalability. We have used Firebase as  database and we choose the native android app as compared to a hybrid app to boost its scalability and performance.  Viridi can be completely used in our real-life issues related to Stubble management. This is built considering all major and minor problems of farmers and government. This is the final step towards the utilization of stubble in an efficient way. From a learning platform to an e-commerce platform, our app has all features needed to save the environment from Stubble burning.
### 4.Working of Viridi💻
First of all, our app provide OTP authentication at first page so only authenticated users can use it.
We created five components in our app:

SELL STUBBLE: to the farmers who don't want to utilize, they can sell the stubble to the needy or request government to pick up their stubble and use it in more efficient ways like biogas plant, manure making, etc.

BUY STUBBLE: the option is for the person who needs stubble for their business or uses. Our app will search for the nearest available stubble and also provide buyers to search for a shipping vehicle so that they can get it to their doorstep.

CRAFT MARKET: this option will allow our user to buy and sell products made up of Stubbles encouraging the use of Stubbles and empowering small businesses. It will create huge employment opportunities in the rural area.

BOOK MACHINE: this option allows our users to check the availability of shipping vehicles and innovative machines for stubble management. To be precise, this will provide accessibility of all, accessibility for all.

LEARN SKILLS: we need to learn to earn. So, this feature of your app provides the best skills needed to learn for stubble utilization.
