# Viridi
Viridi - this application is focused on decreasing the pollution level in India and empowering farmers by allowing them to sell the stubble (commonly known as parali). 
The burning of stubble is one of the greatest reasons behind pollution in Delhi. By providing farmers the opportunity to sell the stubble and crafts made by stubble to various industries throughout India,
it will result in less pollution and this will increase the overall income of all farmers and providing them money for waste management and also allow various industries to grow and create Atmnirbhar Bharat. 
Also, you can learn to make use of stubble using our application so that a person can learn the required skills to make use of stubble and create more opportunities for making money for himself and also for others.
Supporting the idea of PMKVY.
